# GA Library

This project allow to developer using genetic algorithm library writes solution of problem in methods of optimization.

Genetic Algorithm is a evolation at AI scope, is solution based generating chromosome and two operators called by mutation and crossover in some generation repeatedly so providing the best solution in most conjunctive and discrete problem.

## Features
### Manipulation chromosome for making decision
Consider we have a game like Tic-Tac-Toe. When CPU starts this game, it choices cell randomly. This cell saves. User gets at the next time. The certain cell is also selected. That cell also append to save. GA starts with initial sub-chromosome to make decision at next time.
