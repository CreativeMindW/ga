# GA Library

This project allow to developer using genetic algorithm library writes solution of problem in methods of optimization.

Genetic Algorithm is a evolation at AI scope, is solution based generating chromosome and two operators called by mutation and crossover in some generation repeatedly so providing the best solution in most conjunctive and discrete problem.

## Install
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Check out this repository where you are desire. In Terminal/Cmd, enter your folder and running `npm install` to install all of dependencies package so running `npm start` to start this library. Enter `127.0.0.1:1234` or `localhost:1234` at browser to see it.

## Features
### Manipulation chromosome for making decision
Consider we have a game like Tic-Tac-Toe. When CPU starts this game, it choices cell randomly. This cell saves. User gets at the next time. The certain cell is also selected. That cell also append to save. GA starts with initial sub-chromosome to make decision at next time to save a time.
### Limitation Domain
It may be limit to process machine learning for AI application specially strategy game like Tic-Tac-Toe
